            | The Network by Centurion is the flagship project of Centurion
            | Market Advisory Group. A community organised in 2017 originally
            | for the sales and distribution of the cryptocurrency Ducatus
            | Coin (DUC), The Network today is spread across 180 countries
            | worldwide and has over 117,000 registered accounts.

            | The Compensation Plan created by Centurion for The Network
            | offers partners eight different commissions. Premiums and
            | bonuses are paid for DSV Package (Digital Shopping Voucher)
            | purchases made by the community. Through a very modern
            | administration and invoicing programme, sales commissions are
            | recorded in real time and credited directly to partners&rsquo; various
            | accounts. Network partners enjoy the flexibility to decide on
            | how to redeem their DSV on multiple platforms. All these
            | options, from premium Ducatus Merchandise to the latest gadgets,
            | electronics, and more, may be redeemed in the Member Portal.
